1.  Introduction

   This document defines two encapsulation formats for RATS conceptual
   messages (Section 8 of [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture]).

   TODO use cases (TLS, cert extensions, long-term storage, use in API
   payloads, other)

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   In this document, CDDL [RFC8610] [RFC9165] is used to describe the
   data formats.

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the vocabulary and concepts
   defined in [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture].

3.  Conceptual Message Wrapper Encodings

   Two types of RATS Conceptual Message Wrapper (CMW) are specified in
   this document:

   1.  a CMW using a CBOR or a JSON array (Section 3.1)

   2.  a CMW based on CBOR tags (Section 3.2).

3.1.  CMW Array

   The CMW array illustrated in Figure 1 is composed of two members:

   *  type: ether a text string representing a media-type [RFC6838] or
      an unsigned integer corresponding to a CoAP Content-Format
      [RFC7252]

   *  value: the RATS conceptual message serialized according to the
      value defined in the type member.

   A CMW array can be encoded as CBOR [STD94] or JSON [RFC8259].

   When using JSON, the value field is encoded as Base64 using the URL
   and filename safe alphabet (Section 5 of [RFC4648]) without padding.

   When using CBOR, the value field is serialized as a CBOR bytes
   string.

  cmw = [ type, value ]

  type = coap-content-format / media-type

  coap-content-format = uint .size 2
  media-type = text .abnf ("media-type" .cat RFC6838)

  value = cbor-bytes / base64-string

  cbor-bytes = bytes
  base64-string = text .regexp "[A-Za-z0-9_-]+"

  RFC6838 = '
  media-type = type-name "/" subtype-name *1("+" suffix) parameters

  type-name = restricted-name
  subtype-name = restricted-name

  ; see https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-type-structured-suffix/
  suffix = "xml" / "json" / "ber" / "cbor" / "der" / "fastinfoset" /
           "wbxml" / "zip" / "tlv" / "json-seq" / "sqlite3" / "jwt" /
           "gzip" / "cbor-seq" / "zstd"

  parameters = *(";" parameter-name "=" parameter-value)

  parameter-name = restricted-name
  parameter-value = *VCHAR

  restricted-name = restricted-name-first *126restricted-name-chars
  restricted-name-first  = ALPHA / DIGIT
  restricted-name-chars  = ALPHA / DIGIT / "!" / "#" / "$" / "&" / "-" /
                           "^" / "_"
  restricted-name-chars =/ "." ; Characters before first dot always
                               ; specify a facet name
  restricted-name-chars =/ "+" ; Characters after last plus always
                               ; specify a structured syntax suffix

  VCHAR = %x21-7E            ; Visible (printing) characters
  ALPHA = %x41-5A / %x61-7A  ; A-Z / a-z
  DIGIT = %x30-39            ; 0-9
  '

3.2.  CMW CBOR Tags

   CBOR Tags used as CMW are derived from CoAP Content Format values.
   If a CoAP Content Format exists for a RATS conceptual message, the
   TN() transform defined in Appendix B of [RFC9277] can be used to
   derive a CBOR tag in range [1668546817, 1668612095].

4.  Examples

   The (equivalent) examples below assume the media-type application/
   vnd.example.rats-conceptual-msg has been registered alongside a
   corresponding CoAP content format 30001.  The CBOR tag 1668576818 is
   derived applying the TN transform as described in Section 3.2.

   [
     30001,
     h'abcdabcd'
   ]

                          Figure 2: CBOR encoding

   [
     "application/vnd.example.rats-conceptual-msg",
     "q82rzQ"
   ]

                          Figure 3: JSON encoding

   1668576818(h'abcdabcd')

                             Figure 4: CBOR tag

5.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

6.  IANA Considerations

   When registering a new media type for evidence, in addition to its
   syntactical description, the author SHOULD provide a public and
   stable description of the signing and appraisal procedures associated
   with the data format.
